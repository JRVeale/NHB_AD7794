# NHB_AD7794
Arduino Library for the Analog Devices AD7794 24bit ADC

This is essentially just a new fork of the [JJ_AD7794](https://github.com/jjuliano77/JJ_AD7794) library. I have also changed to an MIT license.

This library has been tested with ATMEGA328, ATMEGA32u4, SAMD21, Teensy 3.2, and Esp8266* (The Esp8266 has goofy SPI and requires a some workarounds).
